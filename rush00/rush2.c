//We need to know
int width;
int height;

//And corners:
top left = char tl;
top right = char tr;
bottom left = char bl;
bottom right = char br;


width = strlen of first line argument
height = count of line arguments

tl = first character of first line
tr = last char of 1st line
bl = first character of nth line, where n = count
br = last character of nth line, where n = count
